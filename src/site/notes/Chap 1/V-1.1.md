# Dharmakshetre Kurukshetre 

## 📜 Sanskrit Verse

**धर्मक्षेत्रे कुरुक्षेत्रे समवेता युयुत्सवः।**  
**मामकाः पाण्डवाश्चैव किमकुर्वत संजय।। 1।।**

## 🪶 Transliteration

**dharmakṣetre kurukṣetre samavetā yuyutsavaḥ |**  
**māmakāḥ pāṇḍavāścaiva kimakurvata sañjaya || 1||**

## 🌐 Translation (Literal)

Dhritarashtra said: O Sanjay, after gathering on the holy field of Kurukshetra, and desiring to fight, what did my sons and the sons of Pandu do?

## 🎯 Core Meaning (My Words)


**Gita begins not with Krishna**, not with Arjuna, not even with the battle 
it begins with **blindness**. It begins with **Dhritarashtra**, the blind king, asking, “_धर्मक्षेत्रे कुरुक्षेत्रे समवेता युयुत्सवः..._ What did my sons and the sons of Pandu do, O Sanjaya?”


### 🕶️ The Blind King Within  [[Dhritarashtra\|Dhritarashtra]]

Although Dhritarashtra does not have any physical blindness, he has not one ounce of conscious perception. While Dhritarashtra can see the palace he lives in, the thousands of subjects under him, and the heights to which he has a positioned himself, he still cannot perceive the things that motivate him towards all of the above; that being his own greed and attachment.

This implies that **we** are all blinded to some degree because we live out of unconsciousness(Same as what Mahavira called it as Murcha) or by following the habits we create through conditioning.

The way in which we believe we see is created through our conditioning, or the programming that we have received from family and society.

### ⚔️ Kurukshetra — The Battlefield of Dharma

Dharmakshetra is a place of worship and devotion on earth where human beings continue to wage wars against one another, based on their belief in a higher power, their pursuit of righteousness and their adherence to a set of religious principles. 

This battle within ourselves is also conducted through prayer and meditation; this battle for inner peace is fought each day by individuals who struggle to overcome anger, satisfy desires and Master their mind (establish control over their thoughts & emotions).

Participating in the temple of your being allows the individual to engage in this ongoing struggle to find balance and harmony within themselves as well as with others around them.

### 👁️ Sanjaya The Watcher Within

Sanjaya represents the "seer" who sees across distances as a "testimony" or "eye-witness." In the Indian spiritual traditions, the term for this form of seeing is **साक्षी भाव (sakshi bhav)** or the "witness consciousness". It reflects the awareness we possess when observing the world outside of our thoughts or emotions without any attachment to what we witness.

When Dhritarashtra experienced blindness, he nonetheless had a desire to experience an understanding of the world outside of his immediate perception. Dhritarashtra found clarity by using Sanjaya as a channel to connect with this knowledge. The internal flame that dwells within Dhritarashtra allowed him to observe himself and connect with his knowledge. Sanjaya was the vehicle through which Dhritarashtra connected to the truth of what was taking place around him - all the events and actions taking place on the battlefield were reported to him by Sanjaya.

Similarly, when we take a moment and stop to ponder over the thoughts that race through our minds, we can see the world through the eyes of Sanjaya. We do not have to identify ourselves with our thoughts and beliefs, nor do we need to act on what our emotions compel us to do. Instead, we simply become aware of what happens around us through our own perception, with no need for external validation.


### 🧘 The Modern Kurukshetra

The never-ending cycle of war is as evident today as it was thousands of years ago, leading to many conflicts within ourselves  both environmentally and personally.
