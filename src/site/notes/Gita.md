- I have taken my first step down the path to the Gita, towards living with clarity, stability, and knowing who I am.
- Although I do not yet know where I am going, I will take each step in earnest.
- All small things matter when they point in a good direction.
- I open a doorway to be a part of a wealth of knowledge from others who have gone before me, and now it is my time to learn.
